Soy disease detection

# 1 - problem

The proposed demonstration for the detection of diseases in soybean will benefit from one of the Deep Learning(DL) techniques in the field of Computer Vision or Computer Vision(CV). This being the Convolutional Neural Networks or CNNs which, in turn, have the ability to learn (train) representations from a set of image samples using computational models with several layers.
